# CS3398--Maggia--Fall2019

# Chess++

> This will be our redesigned chess game that will include additional pieces, goals, unlocks, as well as extended boards. We will begin by making the standard game of chess at first. Eventually, our team, Guillermo Gomez, Roy Grady, Kody Davis, Felipe Rodriguez, and Kieran Hsieh, will add more pieces, spaces, goals, and achievements in-game. Our goal is to test our own personal skills by creating something similar yet different. This project is for chess enthusiasts who want some variety in their gameplay. We hope to create an interesting and dynamic chess game that will be user friendly, challenging, fun, and unique.

## Sprint 1 Review

* Roy Grady

  -        I created the code for the board representation as well as all of the computations for
           the possible moves the pieces can make. I also managed how the board recognizes where
           the pieces are and the conditions for absolute pins, interference squares, and checkmate.
           My code in GitHub is everything in Board.java, WhitePawn.java, WhiteBishop.java,
           WhiteKnight.java, WhiteRook.java, WhiteQueen.java, WhiteKing.java, BlackPawn.java, 
           BlackBishop.java, BlackKnight.java, BlackRook.java, BlackQueen.java, BlackKing.java, 
           and PawnPromotion.java. The main branch I used when updating my code was in RoyTemp.
  
  -        My next step is to implement online functionality and allow for multiple board sizes,
           as well as finish the remaining classic chess functions like stalemates, castling, and en passant.
           
* Kieran Hsieh

  -        Completed the chess GUI, which can be found in ChessGUI.java under the Board branch. This was used to visually represent 
           the board, and was used in the Menu as something that opened after the play button was clicked.
  -        My next step will be to connect profiles and users to the GUI
           
* Guillermo Gomez

  -        I created the basic main menu interface for the chess game. I implemented the standard play button as well as other optional
           buttons such as settings and profile. This menu can be found under the Menu.java class, using the Button class to create the
           buttons in the menu. All these classes are under the Menu branch. 
           
* Kody Davis

  -        I helped with the construction of the GUI by finding pictures of chess pieces as well as a way
           to read them in and show them on the board. I also added the menu bar with the options button on top
           of the board as a way to change the color of the board for player customization. Only one color can
           be selected at a time and one color must always be selected. The branch I used to track my changes is
           called KodyGUI.
  -        My next step will be to implement a color wheel or some sort of color choosing mechanism that will 
           allow the user to have a greater selection of colors. I would also like to find different models for
           the chess pieces that can be changed in the settings menu. One last thing I will work towards is the
           implementation of a save option that will allow users to resume a game in progress.
           
* Felipe Rodriguez

  -        The user profile has been completed as a constructor that will inititate the players ELO score along 
           all other information such as name, username, date of birth, etc. 
           
           Things I will be working on:
           - I will get with guillermo to implement the user profile option in the menu 
           - Create a customizable timer for players to use 
           - Creating an ELO grading system that will be integrated in user profiles 
           - add a playlist feature that will allow users to play their own music or go with the classical music integrated
           
           
           Things I am thinking about incorperating 
           - a feature that shows the odds of a player winning without music then comparing to results once music is played
           - a news feed to let competative players know when there is an in person tournament going on via zipcode 
           
## Sprint 2 Review

* Roy Grady

  -      I added the code for stalemates, en passants, and castling. I also significantly refactored 
         the board and pieces code so that it follows more principles and is more compatible with 
         additional features. I implemented preliminary code for server/client connections that 
         will be able to fully work by the next sprint. These artifacts can be found in the source 
         folder as all of the individual piece files, Board.java, Pieces.java, PieceTypes.java, 
         PieceInit.java, ChessServer.java, ChessClient.java, ServerGui.java, and ClientGui.java.
  
  -      My next step is to implement online functionality and allow for multiple board sizes,
         as well as finish the remaining classic chess functions like stalemates, castling, and en passant.

* Kieran Hsieh

  -      	Implemented the builder piece and the new game modes after refactoring the basic GUI code. This is shown by the                         MainBoardPanel.java, ChessGui.java, BulletChessGui.java, ChessGuiPlus.java, GenericBoardPanel.java and it's offshoots,                   HistoryPanel.java, and InfoPanel.java.
  
* Guillermo Gomez

  -      Completed the Menu GUI as well as implement the settings of the game as well as the profile creation menu. The files that                contain these implenetations are Menu.java, ProfileMenu.java, Profile.java, SettingsMenu.java, and Button.java.
  -      My next step will be to finish the database of the Profile creation. I will also add more settings features in the Settings
         Menu. If possible, I will also add music functionality as well as sounds effects within the Menu. 

* Kody Davis
  -     I completely remade the Options menu, which now allows for customization of pieces as well as board colors. The 
        artwork for the pieces are credited in the Inspiration tab of this ReadMe, though I did recolor and resize the 
        originally all-white pieces. Pieces are no longer tied to a specific set, but are unique to the player who chooses
        them. There is no color customization for pieces as of yet, however the board color is completely customizable
        with the user now being able to choose from a much larger set of colors as well as specify specific RGB values if
        they would like. MenuBuilder.java and ColorMenu.java contain the majority of the code responsible for implementing
        these features. Images.java also assists in managing the piece models in the "img" folder. They can all be found
        in the KodyGUI and master branches of the team Github repo.
  -     My next steps will be to begin working on a save function for the game so that games can be exited without having
        to completely start over. Once created, users will be able to save their game from the options menu and load a
        previously saved game from the main menu. I would also like to work on drag-and-drop functionality, time permitting.
        If I manage to finish all of this, I will attempt to implement piece color options that are dynamically chosen 
        during runtime as opposed to hard-coding in a plethora of piece color options.
        
* Felipe Rodriguez
  -      I will be working on the music portion of the code as well as intergrate new elo scores for players to have different scoring systems based on the game mode they want to play 
  
## Sprint 3 Review

* Roy Grady

  -      In this sprint, I added the CPU AI with multiple difficulties using the minimax algorithm wth alpha beta pruning. I also added
         new pieces such as the Archer Piece, the Jester Piece, and the Prince Piece. I fixed the rewind feature as well as made the
         online mode work with the newest function. I reformatted the custom options menu and implemmented a custom board option which
         allows users to make their own board setup as well as select which pieces can be promoted to and whose turn it is at the
         beginning. Lastly, I made the icons for the new pieces and made the visuals for the last move that was made.
         
  -      My artifacts are New.png in the img folder, and my artifacts in src are the files in the Engine, Options, and Online package
         as well SetOtherButtons.java, SetPiecesFrame.java, SetPiecesSelect.java, phScroll.java, and SetPiecesBoard.java in
         the GUI package. These files make up the custom board mode and the scroll for the piece history. Finally, i heavily edited 
         the CustomMenu.java file in the Menu package where I formatted the way in which you select the options for the custom mode.
         

* Kieran Hsieh

  -      Added Builder piece(cut feature), old version under KieranTemp branch and Builder.java, Worked on rewind feature, found in rewind function on Board.java.
  -      My next step will be to add a limit to the amount of pieces you can add in the custom board mode.
  
* Guillermo Gomez

  -      Completed the Menu GUI entirely as a fullt functional menu. The musicplayer was also added to the menu so we now have a 
         music player in the background while you play. This implementations are in Menu.java, CustomMain.java, CustomMenu,java, and 
         MusicPlayer.java
  -      My next step will be to fully complete Profile creation. Bugs are still present in the the Profile but will be fixed for the next release. 

* Kody Davis

  -    For Sprint 3, the main task I completed was the implementation of colored circles to mark valid move locations. Because the board
       can be changed to any color in the RGB spectrum, the colored circle markers dynamically change based on the current board color.
       Previously, the valid move locations were indicated by a red border around the board square. I also managed to implement drag and
       drop functionality, as well as the ability to save a game in progress in an earlier version of the game, but I was ultimately
       unable to add them to the final version of the game due to time constraints. The code for the colored circles can be found on the
       main branch in the files CustomCircles.java and ChessSquare.java. A functional drag and drop/save-able version of the game can be
       found in the KodyGUI branch, specifically in the Saves folder and the MyGlassPane.java file, and a newer version that only
       includes the save feature can be found in the KodyTemp branch.
  
  -      My next step would be to limit the option to choose different pieces when playing the new game modes or add more pieces to the
         existing piece sets so that they are still usable. I would also like to add the ability to save a game in progress as well as
         the ability to drag and drop pieces in addition to clicking to move.
        
* Felipe Rodriguez
-      I completed the GUI for the music player and was able to add the basic functionality for users to play with  
         MusicPlayer.java
  -      My next step will be to incorperate a method that will allow sounds to be played when a given piece is destroyed
